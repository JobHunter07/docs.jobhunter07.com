## General Questions

### What is JobHunter07?

JobHunter07 is a community-owned employment platform that puts workers first. Unlike traditional job boards, we're governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), meaning our users collectively own and control the platform.

### How is JobHunter07 different from LinkedIn or Indeed?

- **Ownership**: Our community owns the platform through the DAO
- **Data**: You control your data—we don't sell it to third parties
- **Transparency**: Our code is open source, and governance is public
- **Community**: We prioritize mutual support over competition
- **Business Model**: We serve users, not advertisers

### Is JobHunter07 free to use?

Yes, core features are free for job seekers. We're exploring sustainable revenue models that don't exploit user data, including optional premium features and employer services.

### Do I need cryptocurrency to use JobHunter07?

No. While we use a token system for governance and incentives, you can use the core job-seeking features without any crypto knowledge or wallet.

We only collect data necessary to provide our services: profile information you choose to share, job search activity, and platform usage. See our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy) for full details.

### Who can see my data?

Only you control who sees your data. You decide what information to include in your profile, which employers to share it with, and how visible you are on the platform.

### Can I delete my account and data?

Yes, absolutely. You can export or delete your data at any time. We comply with data protection regulations and respect your right to be forgotten.

### Do you sell user data?

**No, never.** Selling user data violates our core values. We will never monetize your personal information.
