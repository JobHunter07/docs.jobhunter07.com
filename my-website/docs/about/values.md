# Our Values

The principles that guide everything we build and every decision we make.

---

## 1. Community First

**The community is not our users—they are our owners.**

- We build *with* the community, not *for* them
- Governance decisions are made democratically through the DAO
- Community members share in the value they help create
- We prioritize community needs over investor demands

---

## 2. Radical Transparency

**Trust is built through openness, not secrecy.**

- Our code is open source
- Governance processes are public and documented
- Financial decisions and treasury management are fully transparent
- Algorithm logic and data usage are clearly explained
- We admit mistakes and share what we learn

---

## 3. Human-Centered Design

**Technology should serve people, not exploit them.**

- Design for dignity, not engagement metrics
- Make complex systems simple and accessible
- Consider emotional and mental health impacts
- Default to privacy and user control
- Build features that empower, not addict

---

## 4. Data Sovereignty

**Your data is yours. Period.**

- Users own and control their personal data
- Explicit consent is required for any data use
- Data can be exported or deleted at any time
- No selling user data to third parties
- Clear, honest privacy policies in plain language

---

## 5. Economic Justice

**Work has dignity. Workers deserve respect and fair compensation.**

- Fair distribution of platform value
- Support for contributors at all skill levels
- Transparent compensation structures
- No exploitative practices
- Living wages for platform workers and contributors

---

## 6. Inclusivity & Accessibility

**Everyone deserves access to meaningful work and opportunity.**

- Design for users of all abilities
- Remove barriers to participation
- Actively fight bias in algorithms and processes
- Support underrepresented communities
- Make participation affordable or free

---

## 7. Collaboration Over Competition

**We rise together.**

- Support > rivalry among job seekers
- Share knowledge, referrals, and opportunities
- Celebrate others' successes
- Build partnerships with aligned organizations
- Open source our innovations for the broader community

---

## 8. Sustainability

**Build for the long term, not quick profits.**

- Sustainable business models that don't rely on exploitation
- Environmental consciousness in operations
- Decisions that prioritize long-term community health
- Resist pressure to "grow at all costs"
- Plan for generational impact

---

## 9. Accountability

**Power requires responsibility.**

- Clear code of conduct for all participants
- Consequences for harmful behavior
- Responsive moderation and conflict resolution
- Regular community check-ins and feedback loops
- Leadership that serves the community

---

## 10. Continuous Learning

**We don't have all the answers—and that's okay.**

- Iterate based on feedback
- Experiment, measure, and adapt
- Learn from failures
- Share lessons with the community
- Evolve our values as we grow

---

## Living Our Values

These aren't just words on a page. We hold ourselves accountable by:

- Publishing quarterly community reports
- Conducting regular community surveys
- Accepting public feedback on governance decisions
- Empowering community members to call out misalignment
- Evolving these values through open DAO discussions

---

## Value Conflicts

When values conflict, we:

1. Bring the conflict to the community
2. Discuss trade-offs transparently
3. Let the DAO vote on how to proceed
4. Document the decision and reasoning

No value is absolute—what matters is how we navigate complexity together.
