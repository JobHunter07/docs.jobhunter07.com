# JobHunter07 Overview

JobHunter07 is a community‑run, human‑first employment platform designed to give job seekers the power, clarity, and support they deserve. Our mission is simple: **build a fair, transparent, community‑owned employment ecosystem** where workers—not corporations—control their data, their opportunities, and their future.

This documentation site is organized to serve three audiences:

- **Users** who want to understand and use JobHunter07  
- **Contributors** who want to build, design, or improve the platform  
- **Community Members & Governance Participants** who help shape the DAO, proposals, and long‑term direction  

To support this, we use a clear, scalable folder structure that keeps everything discoverable and future‑proof.

## Documentation Structure

Below is the full structure used across this site. Each section is designed to be intuitive, modular, and aligned with how a community‑run organization operates.

## Why This Structure Works

### Clear separation of audiences  
Users, contributors, and governance participants each have their own dedicated space, making navigation intuitive.

### Community‑first transparency  
Governance, proposals, and tokenomics are fully visible and easy to reference.

### Scales with the project  
As JobHunter07 grows, new BRDs, PRDs, features, and proposals can be added without reorganizing the entire site.

### Contributor‑friendly  
Engineers, designers, and community moderators all have clear entry points.

### User‑friendly  
People exploring JobHunter07 for the first time can quickly understand what it is, how it works, and how to get started.
